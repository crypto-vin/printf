# 0x11. C - printf

# Tasks:

In this project, we recreated a mini-verison of the ```printf``` function found in > the ```stdio.h``` library in the C programming language. This function allows > us to print any argument given to the standard output or terminal and similar > printing functions can be found in any programming language. This means we can > print any combinations of strings, intergers, and other different data types.

# Synopsis

This repository holds all the code necessary for our custom _printf function to run. Our mini-version currently handles conversion specifiers: c, s, %, d, i, b, o and does not yet support field width, precision, flag characters, or length modifiers. Unique to our _printf is our r reverse conversion and the R rot13 conversion. In essence, you can print any character, string, integer, or decimal number, reverse your strings, transform any number to binary and octal bases, and encrypt your string with rot13 encryption.
